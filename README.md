# MERN WatchStore (DialHouse-style)

This repository is a ready-to-edit starter MERN project for an eCommerce watch store.

## Quick start (local)
1. Start MongoDB (e.g. `mongod`).
2. Backend:
   - `cd server`
   - copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run seed` (optional, adds sample products)
   - `npm run dev`
3. Frontend:
   - `cd client`
   - copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run dev`

Client runs at `http://localhost:5173` and backend at `http://localhost:5000` by default.
